# GridScanner

## Installation guide
*Prerequisits:*
* This project uses Telerik UI, download trial version of telerik form: https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui
* This project uses .NET Aspire
* This project uses an SQL Server

After downloading "TelerikUIForBlazorSetup" from "https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui" run the installer and select Telerik UI for Blazor and Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core *Visual studio needs to be closed for this step* -> NEXT -> "Accept the license agreement" -> NEXT -> Log into telerik... again -> INSTALL -> AGREE :)
*NOTE Telerik will call about the trial period in a day or two since they are super invested in making sales and providing support :D

### When Proxy Authentication Required pops up -> Its Telerik... yes it wants your email and passowrd again!

For .NET Aspire search from NuGet: Aspire.Hosting.AppHost Make sure to be on __All__ or __nuget.org__

If you do not have an SQL server locally running, you can grab the "developer edition" from: "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads" (no sign up required).
"Basic" installation will suffice.

# Update Database
Easyest way to spin up a database is to run the "Update-Database" via Package Manager Console. *Make sure to first select GridScanner.ApiService* as the launch project and GridScanner.Data as the default project*
